# Python Bootcamp Final Project - G ratio automation

## Installation
Use the package manager pip to install G-ratio_automation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can download test folder


## Purpose of the code:
Automation of g-ratio measurement

In the community of labs studying the nervous system, the quantification of a parameter called “g-ratio” is critical. This parameter takes a cross section image of a nerve (obtained by Electron microscopy) and measures the diameter of single fibers (axons) with and without the insulating layer (called myelin). This ratio indicates the velocity in which electrical signals travel in the fibers and intern reflect on the properties and health of the nerve. 

Currently, g-ratio quantification is done manually in my lab, a task which is tedious and extremely time-consuming. Using Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV), this python code is able to detect the outline of the myelin layer and calculate the g-ratio automatically after setting a single threshold parameter for each image. This allows to collect data on a much larger scale and accuracy in just a few minutes. 

## How to use the code:

Once code is running – a threshold bar and 4 stacked images with/out filters will show up as follows:

Diagram 1

When user clicks “c” - a plot containing two images with labeled contours will show up like so:

Diagram 2

User can zoom and verify contour outlines are precise. If not, user may exit this window, adjust threshold bar and click “c” again.

Once settled on threshold, user should exit this window and go back to previous window (showing stacked images). 

Now, click “s” for a few seconds, this will export the data from current image to an excel sheet under “G-ratio Automation.xlsx” in current directory. If a finder window pops up – just click “cancel”. 

The table exported includes details on every insulated fiber that was detected. 
Each row is a different fiber, consisting of the inner and outer outline.
Columns include the following details for each fiber: 
Inner and outer circle area, Inner and outer circle radius, axon diameter, genes (group it belongs to) and finally g-ratio. 

Once data on this image is exported, the code will automatically move onto the next image in folder. 

Once user is done with all images in folder, or alternatively by pressing “p” for a few seconds at any given point, a scatter plot containing all labeled cells with their g-ratio will appear:

This plot comparing 2 groups: “WT” (untreated) in red, and “KO” (treated) in blue, is the classic plot used in papers by scientists studying the nervous system and electrical signal conductance, such as my lab.
